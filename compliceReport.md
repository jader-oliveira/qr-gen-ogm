# **Compliance and Validation Report**

**Application:** Euro Payment QR Generator (EPC069-12)

**Date:** 2024-01-11

**Standard:** European Payments Council (EPC) \- Quick Response Code Guidelines (EPC069-12)

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This document certifies that the generated QR codes adhere to the **SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT)** standards as defined by the European Payments Council. The application implements strict input validation, sanitization, and mathematical verification for checksums.

## **2\. Technical Implementation details**

### **2.1 Standard Adherence**

The generator produces a UTF-8 encoded payload consisting of exactly **12 lines** separated by Line Feeds (\\n), adhering to the following schema:

| Line | Field | Constraint | Implementation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Service Tag | Fixed: BCD | Hardcoded |
| 2 | Version | Fixed: 002 | Hardcoded |
| 3 | Character Set | Fixed: 1 (UTF-8) | Hardcoded |
| 4 | Identification | Fixed: SCT | Hardcoded |
| 5 | BIC | Max 11 chars | Auto-stripped of spaces |
| 6 | Name | Max 70 chars | Mandatory |
| 7 | IBAN | Max 34 chars | Modulo 97 Validated |
| 8 | Amount | EUR \+ Amount | formatted to .2f |
| 9 | Purpose | SEPA Code | Optional (e.g., IVPT) |
| 10 | Creditor Ref | ISO 11649 | Must start with RF |
| 11 | Remittance | Max 140 chars | Used for Unstructured/OGM |
| 12 | Info | Max 70 chars | Optional |

### **2.2 Belgian Structured Communication (OGM)**

The application supports the Belgian standard \+++000/0000/00000+++.

* **Validation:** The generator calculates the check digits using **Modulo 97** logic strictly.  
* **Placement:** Per EPC guidelines, non-ISO 11649 references (like OGM) are placed in the **Remittance Information (Line 11\)** field to ensure compatibility with banking apps that do not support proprietary formats in the Structured Reference field.

### **2.3 Input Sanitization**

To prevent user error, the system applies the following rules before generation:

1. **IBAN:** All spaces and non-alphanumeric characters are stripped.  
2. **BIC:** All spaces are stripped.  
3. **Mutual Exclusivity:** The system prevents the simultaneous use of "Structured Reference" (Line 10\) and "Remittance Text" (Line 11), ensuring the QR code is never rejected for ambiguous data.

## **3\. Validation Procedure**

### **Automated Testing**

Unit tests are available (uniTests.py) covering:

* IBAN Checksum verification (Mod 97).  
* OGM Checksum verification (Mod 97).  
* Payload structural integrity.

### **Manual Verification Checklist**

Authorities or users may verify the validity of the QR code using any standard banking application (e.g., KBC, Belfius, ING, BNP Paribas).

**Success Criteria:**

1. **Beneficiary Name** is populated correctly.  
2. **IBAN** matches the input exactly.  
3. **Amount** (if provided) matches exactly.  
4. **Communication:** The \+++...+++ string appears in the message/communication field.

## **4\. Conclusion**

The output generated by this software is fully compliant with the **EPC069-12** standard and is safe for use in commercial invoicing within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).
